# libserum (concentrate)
This is a (friendly) fork of [libserum](https://github.com/zesinger/libserum), the great cross-platform library for decoding Serum files, a colorization format for pinball ROMs, created and maintained by [Zed](https://github.com/zesinger).

While the main development still happens in libserum itself, libserum (concentrate) is a drop-in replacement, especially for low-memory devices like mobile devices, VR headsets or real pinball machines.

## Disclaimer
The code is a bit more complicated, might not always be up-to-date with the original and might introduce new bugs.
libserum (concentrate) is not meant to replace libserum entirely.
